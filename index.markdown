Welcome to my academic page.


# Introduction
I am a PhD student in numerical simulations under the direction of [Alexandre Ern](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~ern/) at CERMICS. My other supervisors are Olivier Jamond (CEA) and Florence Drui (CEA).

**PhD topic** : I am working on the use of HHO (Hybrid-high order) methods in the context of structural dynamics. The goal is to apply the spacial HHO discrete operator on dynamic equations solved with explicit time algorithms.
My first years of PhD were dedicated to the conception of an explicite time integration algorithm for the the acoustic wave equation (linear and non-linear).
The last year of my PhD focuses on the application of the algorithm to numerical simulations in fast structural dynamics.

# Curriculum
I graduated from [ENSTA Paris](https://www.ensta-paristech.fr/) engineering school in Septembre 2020. There I chose to specialize in applied mathematics for numerical simulation. For this purpose I simultaneously studied at Paris-Saclay University, to obtain my master degree from master [AMS](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/mathematics-and-applications/m2-analyse-modelisation-simulation) in 2020.

During my education I had several internship :
- 6 months at EDF Lab in Saclay where I studied a post-processing method for neutron equation.
- 6 months at the BNC in Montreal where I worked on learning algorithms.
- 6 months at CEA Saclay as an introduction for my PhD.

# Teaching 
- *AO102 2021-2022 and 2022-2023* : Dynamic Systems (study of ordinary differential equations). This course is taught to undergraduate students of ENSTA Paris.
- *AnaCS 2021-2022* : Analysis and scientific computing for undergraduate engineering students at the ENPC. This course is taught in a flipped classroom.
- *Introduction to research project 2021* : Supervision of a research project for a group of four undergraduate student at ENPC. The project aimed at simulating wave propagation phenomena with the finite elements method. The Python computer code was entirely developed by the students.

# Personnal projects
I am interested in gluten-free lifestyle, since I eat gluten-free myself. This lead me to create my own dedicated website : [Glutons](https://glutons.fr/). I developed the website myself (django for the backend and bootstrap for the front-end) and I also write articles subjects related to gluten-free eating : health, recipes, adresses. Hence, this website is both a personal project dedicated to a subject dear to me, and a technical project, allowing me to employ my technical skills to another area of work than my PhD. Do not hesitate to have a look (only in French for the time being) !
